Steps to compile & run program:
1. Create a testing directory in Linux/WSL
2. Include banker.cpp into directory
3. Compile the program by using "g++ banker.cpp -o banker" (Make sure your system has the g++ compiler)
4. Make a 5 by 4 matrix inputfile that represents the inital maximum resources
5. Run program by entering "./banker inputfile.txt" into command line
6. Program will continue indefinitely, so terminate program when evaluation is done.
